Scope and Limitations

Scope:
The study focuses on the development of a web-based information management system for the Barangay Health Center of Sta. Ana, Tagoloan. The system includes the following features:
- Patient registration and demographic management
- Consultation records and medical history tracking
- Immunization schedule management and tracking
- Report generation for health programs and compliance
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions

Limitations:
- The system does not include hospital-level diagnostics or pharmacy inventory management.
- Integration with national health databases (e.g., DOH) is not supported in real-time.
- The system is designed as a local management tool for Brgy. Sta. Ana and does not synchronize with external facilities.
- While the system facilitates referrals to external facilities and tracks medicine batches for inventory awareness, it is not intended for large-scale inventory management.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) distinguishes between the capabilities of system administrators (user management) and barangay health workers (patient care).
